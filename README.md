##  Features

### Accessibility Highlights

- **Readable Header Tagline**  
  Bold, large fonts with high contrast and darkened background image for clarity.

- **Semantic HTML5 Structure**  
  Uses `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and logical heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) for screen readers and clarity.

- **Descriptive Alt Text**  
  All images include meaningful `alt` attributes for assistive technologies.

- ** Accessible Form**  
  Labels are associated with input fields via `for` and `id`, and use `required` to support screen reader prompts.

- **Keyboard Navigation**  
  All navigation links and buttons are easily focusable with a keyboard.

- ** Clear CTAs**  
  Buttons use descriptive text like “Shop Now” and meet WCAG color contrast standards.
